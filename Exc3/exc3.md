# SDN Exercise 3

## Problem 3.1 - SDN Relatives to OpenFlow

### a) Concrete SDN implementation

> Name three concrete implementations/instantiations of the SDN concept, other than OpenFlow
> and ForCES.

- OpenContrail: http://www.opencontrail.org/
- VMWare NSX: https://www.vmware.com/de/products/nsx.html
- Floodlight: http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/
- Big Switch - Big Network Controller: https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Big-Switch-Big-Network-Controller

Found in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914007327

### b) Forwarding and Control Element Separation

> The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Framework was standardized by the
> IETF in 2004 (RFC 3746). Please revisit the concepts presented in the lecture on ForCES by
> reading Section 1 and 2 of the standard document and answer the following questions. RFC
> 3746: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3746

#### 1) Explain the responsibilities of Control Elememts (CEs) and Forwarding Elements (FEs) in ForCES

Control Elements:
- Give directives to FE how packets have to be forwarded
- Execute control and signal protocols
- Master role in protocol
- Located in control plane

Forwarding Elements:
- Implements packet forwarding as directed by CR
- Slave role in protocol, no FE-FE communication
- Located in data plane 

#### 2) What does the standard state as reason for the separation between FEs and CEs?

- Standardize information exchange between the control and forwarding plane
- Vendors can specialize in one component without having to become experts in all components
- CE and FE from different vendors
- Increased design choices and flexibility for the system vendors
- Enables rapid innovation in both the control and forwarding planes while maintaining interoperability
- Provide better scalability for each separated part instead of scaling both parts

## Problem 3.2 - The OpenFlow Protocol

### a) TCP flag matching - Examples

> OpenFlow v1.5.0 introduces the possibility of TCP flag matching. Name some examples what
> this new feature could be used for and sketch how the solution would work and what other
> OpenFlow features it might require/use.

- Handling urgend packets (URG flag) with higher priority and/or route them to a different route
- Detect beginning and end of a TCP connection, TODO: Benefit?
- TODO: Add more!

### b) Multiple Flow Tables and Pipeline Processing

> Shortly explain the different steps of packet processing inside an OpenFlow Switch with multiple flow tables and in the context of Pipeline Processing

- OpenFlow pipeline consists of two processing types
    - Ingress processing and Egress processing
- Ingress processing: Packet comes to Ingress Port
- Egress processing: Packet send to target port
- Both processing types consists of 1-n flow tables which define an action set for the processing type
- Following Packet process:
    - Packets are pipelined through all flow tables of Ingress processing
    - Packets are processed in a Group Table TODO: What does this one?
    - Packets are pipelined through all flow tables of Egress processing

## Problem 3.3 - Flow Spaces

### a) Flow Space Analysis

> Flow spaces can be visualized in a multidimensional space. Fill in the flow spaces corresponding to the given flow rules of the table. Note the number of the corresponding rule next to the corresponding figure.
